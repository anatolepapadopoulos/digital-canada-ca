			<h2 class="section--title">We're Hiring</h2>
			<p>The Canadian Digital Service (CDS) works with federal departments to make the services people depend on simple and easy-to-use. We’re a small but mighty team that is rethinking service design and delivery, engaging users every step of the way. By working in the open, and connecting partners with tools, talent, and training grounded in practice, we’re building capacity across the government for better service delivery. And we need you.</p>
			<p>We’re looking for someone to lead our talent operations. In this role, you’ll set a clear, compelling vision for how to attract, develop, and retain top talent. You’ll lead our talent acquisition function with a specific focus on developing and driving sourcing and recruitment efforts. You’ll create strategies that enhance our ability to develop and retain a highly motivated, creative, diverse, and effective workforce —including compensation, culture, and development. This will include establishing talent pipelines and programs for key communities and institutions. You’ll solve policy and operational roadblocks while navigating the rules — and help us rewrite those rules when necessary to modernize how government attracts people with much needed skills to public service.</p>

			<h3>What we’re looking for:</h3>

			<ul>
				<li>You enjoy building high-performing teams and have a proven record of hiring the right candidates for the right positions, particularly in design and tech-centric environments. You revisit regularly to evaluate progress and make adjustments.</li>
				<li>You understand the complexities of recruiting and hiring in large organizations, but you can differentiate between true compliance requirements and practices that have built up over time.</li>
				<li>You are excited about establishing modern talent practices and models that have the potential to scale across government and help drive much-needed increased mobility in and out of the Public Service. </li>
				<li>You have a bias toward action and an appetite for challenging the status quo. You are passionate about making Canada a better place and strive to keep people focused on that outcome.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h3>An excellent candidate will be able to:</h3>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Collaborate at all levels -- from leadership to front-line employees -- to build strong partnerships and drive a comprehensive human capital strategy.</li>
				<li>Source, cultivate, recruit, interview, and hire diverse technical talent that reflects and represents the best of Canada.</li>
				<li>Contribute to the entire talent lifecycle for the CDS “tour of duty” model, from hiring through onboarding, development and support, and offboarding, ensuring that CDSers have good experiences with government and that CDS alumni become champions for the organization and for the methods it is scaling across government.</li>
				<li>Establish human capital programs and processes, and oversee forecasting activity for headcount across CDS.</li>
				<li>Handle challenging conversations with candidates, team members, and leadership from across the businesses you support.</li>
				<li>Learn from failure.</li>
				<li>Model a culture of inclusivity and uphold principles of openness, integrity, and fairness.</li>
				<li>Communicate in both official languages.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>At CDS, we don’t just accept difference, we celebrate it. We proudly, passionately, and actively strive to make CDS more reflective and inclusive of the society that we serve. Our ability to deliver better public services — accessible, inclusive services — can only be realized if we can recognise and harness the most diverse range of thoughts, experiences, and skills. We work hard to create an environment where different perspectives and experiences are valued. We are committed to helping diverse talent thrive.</p>
			
			<p>CDS welcomes all applicants regardless of race, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, national origin, disability, age, veteran status, marital status, pregnancy or family commitments.</p>
			
			<h3>Interested?</h3>
